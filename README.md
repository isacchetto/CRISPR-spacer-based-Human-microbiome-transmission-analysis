# CRISPR-spacer-based Human microbiome transmission analysis
This repository contains the code and test data of my internship project at the [Laboratory of Computational Metagenomics](http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/) of the [CIBIO Department, University of Trento, Italy](https://www.cibio.unitn.it/).

The project is about the analysis of human microbiome transmission using CRISPR spacers.


The project is supervised by Dr. Nicola Segata and Dr. Matteo Ciciani.
